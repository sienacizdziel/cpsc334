# Final Project: Marble Battle
## Siena Cizdziel

## Intro && Usage
Marble Battle is a 2-player competitive interactive game that resembles pong (the video game) but in real life and with marbles! Each player has a controller with two buttons, one to flip 


To start this game, plug it (the ESP32) in to a computer, and all controls will immediately be functional. 
If you'd like auto-scoring, plug in the Raspberry Pi display to a wall outlet; once the Pi turns on, it will automatically boot the program for scoring that will start on a blue "Start" screen. Tap the screen to begin to see scores. 
If you'd like to reset scores, simply unplug and replug the cord attached to the game. 
To turn off the game, simply unplug everything.
