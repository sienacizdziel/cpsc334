Module 1: Generative Art
A Dynamic Beach Landscape
Siena Cizdziel

This is a dynamic generative art piece of an abstract aerial view of a beach. The code is written in Java in Processing (generative_art_java.pde) inside of the generative_art_java folder in this repository. Note that this repo also contains obsolete code written in p5.js, which I couldn't bear to delete so I saved for posterity. 

To run the code: 
* Open generative_art_java.pde (located inside the generative_art_java folder in this repo) in the Processing environment of the LEEDS computer.
* Turn on all projectors and ensure HDMI display cables are secured. 
* Click the play button at the top left of the Processing environment. 

The code is written to then automatically generate the art and display it at the appropriate location on the windows of LEEDS and with the corresponding size of the displays.
